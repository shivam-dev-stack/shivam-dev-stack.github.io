I'm a data scientist who likes to **understand things from first principles** rather than treating models as black boxes. I've spent the last few years working at the intersection of machine learning, statistical inference, and software engineering.

This blog is my public notebook — a place to share what I'm learning, working through, and occasionally getting wrong.

## What I write about

I focus on **practical machine learning** and **statistical thinking** — the kind of material that bridges textbook theory with what actually happens when you deploy a model. Expect posts on:

- Model training, evaluation, and debugging
- Data pipelines and feature engineering  
- Statistical foundations of ML methods
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and friends
- MLOps and productionizing models

## Background

Previously I worked on [some cool thing at some company](#). I hold a degree in [Statistics / CS / Math] from [University]. When I'm not wrangling data, I'm usually hiking or reading about systems thinking.

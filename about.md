I’m Shivam Pratap Singh — an Software Developer focused on building real-world machine learning applications and scalable backend systems.

I enjoy taking ideas from concept to deployment — designing APIs, building data pipelines, and creating ML-powered products that solve practical problems.

Currently, I’m building ML apps in public while deepening my understanding of statistics, system design, and production AI deployment. My long-term goal is to share knowledge through SaaS products, and impactful AI solutions.

Tech stack includes Python, FastAPI, SQL, MongoDB, and Machine Learning, EDA, Deep Learning and MERN.

Outside coding, I enjoy playing cricket and continuously improving my discipline, health, and mindset.
